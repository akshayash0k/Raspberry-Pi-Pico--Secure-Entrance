# Raspberry-Pi-Pico-Secure-Entrance-MicroPython
Secure Door/Entrance Project using Raspberry Pi Pico and Micropython with few other sensor modules (RFID, RGB, Servo, Buzzer).

This Project is demonstration of my learning about using Micropython for Raspberry Pi Pico micro-controller. This was completed with the help of Divya G from Little Monks Laboratories, Chennai (https://g.co/kgs/UYmc4Uy).

The Secure Door/Entrance Project uses Raspberry Pi Pico as the micro-controller and Micropython as the language for communication between various sensor modules used in the project. It is recommended that you have Thonny Python IDE pre-installed on your system. 

Firmware: RPI_PICO-20240602-v1.23.0 (On date of Upload)

Sensors & Modules: RFID (RC522), Servo Motor (SG90), RGB Led, Buzzer

Pin Configuration:
RFID: spi_id=0, sck=6, miso=4, mosi=7, cs=5, rst=22
